  - [ ] Publish a release candidate to npm
    ```sh
    # All successful builds of master update the `build/last-successful` branch
    # which contains an `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
    # This command checks that branch out, installs it's dependencies using `npm ci`,
    # creates a release branch (e.g. release/v0.34.x), updates the minor prerelease
    # version (e.g. 0.33.1 -> 0.34.0-rc.0) and publishes it to npm.
    npx aegir publish-rc

    # Later we may wish to update the rc. First cherry-pick/otherwise merge the
    # new commits into the release branch on github (e.g. not locally) and wait
    # for CI to pass. Then update the lockfiles used by CI (n.b. one day this
    # will be done by our ci tools) with this command:
    npx aegir update-release-branch-lockfiles release/v0.34.x

    # Then update the rc published on npm. This command pulls the specified
    # release branch, installs it's dependencies `npm ci`, increments the
    # prerelease version (e.g. 0.34.0-rc.0 -> 0.34.0-rc.1) and publishes it
    # to npm.
    npx aegir update-rc release/v0.34.x
    ```
