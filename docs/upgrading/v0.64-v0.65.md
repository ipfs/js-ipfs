## libp2p

The upgrade to `ipfs@0.65.x` incorporates an update to `libp2p@0.40.x` but no API changes.

If your application uses only the default libp2p config there is nothing to do.

If you supply a custom `libp2p` instance to the `ipfs` factory function you should consult the [`libp2p@0.40.x` upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/migrations/v0.39-v0.40.md) for any changes you need to make.

## multiformats

`ipfs@0.65.x` now uses `multiformats@10.x.x`, this means instances of the `CID` class now come from that module and not `multiformats@9.x.x` so any `instanceof` checks your codebase has may break if instances are compare to the class loaded from a different module version.

If your project also has a dependency on the `multiformats` module, it should be updated to `10.x.x` in line with js-ipfs.
