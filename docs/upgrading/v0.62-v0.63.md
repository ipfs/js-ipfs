## ESM

The biggest change to `ipfs@0.63.x` is that the module is now [ESM-only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

ESM is the module system for JavaScript, it allows us to structure our code in separate files without polluting a global namespace.

Other systems have tried to fill this gap, notably CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS and others, but ESM is [the official standard format](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules) to package JavaScript code for reuse.

If you see errors similar to `Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: No "exports" main defined in node_modules/ipfs/package.json` you are likely trying to load ESM code from a CJS environment via `require`. This is not possible, instead it must be loaded using `import`.

If your application is not yet ESM or you are not ready to port it to ESM, you can use the [dynamic `import` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) to load `ipfs` at runtime from a CJS module:

```js
async function loadIpfs () {
  const { create } = await import('ipfs-core')

  const node = await create({
    // ... config here
  })

  return node
}
```

## libp2p@0.37.x

`ipfs@0.63.x` upgrades to `libp2p@0.37.x`.  This is a significant refactor that ports the entire stack to TypeScript and publishes all modules as ESM-only code.

Please see the [libp2p 0.37.x` upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/migrations/v0.36-v.037.md) for how this may affect your application.

## PeerIds

The core `libp2p` module and all supporting modules have now been ported to TypeScript in a complete ground-up rewrite. We took this opportunity to solve a few long-standing problems with some of the data types, particularly in how they relate to use in the browser.

One problem we have solved is that the `PeerId` objects used internally expose some cryptographic operations that require heavyweight libraries to be included in browser bundles due to there being no native web-crypto implementation of the algorithms used in those operations.

With `libp2p@0.37.x` those operations have been encapsulated in the `@libp2p/crypto` module which means `PeerId` objects become a lot more lightweight and can now be exposed/accepted as core-api types so we can use them to differentiate between different data types instead of having to treat everything as strings.

The affected methods are:

```js
// `peerId` must now be a `PeerId`, previously it was a `string`
ipfs.bitswap.wantlistForPeer(peerId, options)

// Bitswp peers are now returned as `PeerId[]` instead of `string[]`
ipfs.bitswap.stat(options)

// `peerId` must now be a `PeerId`
ipfs.dht.findPeer(peerId, options)

// `peerIdOrCid` must now be a `PeerId` or a `CID`, previously it was a `string` or a `CID`
ipfs.dht.query(peerIdOrCid, options)

// the following DHT events have their `from` field as `PeerId`, previously it was a `string`
PeerResponseEvent
ValueEvent
DialingPeerEvent

// the following DHT events have had their `from` property removed because it is not exposed by go-ipfs so causes incompatibilities
QueryErrorEvent
FinalPeerEvent

// the folloing DHT events have had their `to` property removed because it is not exposed by go-ipfs so causes incompatibilities
SendingQueryEvent

// the `providers` and `closer` properties (where applicable) of the following events have the `peerId` property specified as a `PeerId`, previously it was a `string`
PeerResponseEvent
PeerResponseEvent

// `value` can now be a string or a `PeerId`.  If a string is passed it will be interpreted as a DNS address.
ipfs.name.resolve(value, options)

// The return type of this method is now `Promise<PeerId[]>`, previously it was a `Promise<string[]>`
ipfs.pubsub.peers(topic, options)

// `peerId` must now be a `PeerId`, previously it was a `string`
ipfs.ping(peerId, options)

// the `peer` property of `options` must now be a `PeerId` when specified, previously it was a `string`
ipfs.stats.bw(options)

// `multiaddrOrPeerId` must be a `Multiaddr` or `PeerId`, previously it was a `Multiaddr` or `string`
ipfs.swarm.connect(multiaddrOrPeerId, options)

// `multiaddrOrPeerId` must be a `Multiaddr` or `PeerId`, previously it was a `Multiaddr` or `string`
ipfs.swarm.disconnect(multiaddrOrPeerId, options)
```

`PeerId`s can be created from strings using the `@libp2p/peer-id` module:

```js
import { peerIdFromString } from '@libp2p/peer-id'

const peerId = peerIdFromString('Qmfoo')
```

They can also be created using the `@libp2p/peer-id-factory` module:

```js
import { createEd25519PeerId } from '@libp2p/peer-id-factory'

const peerId = await createEd25519PeerId()
```

## multiaddrs

The `multiaddr` module has been ported to Typescript and is now published as ESM-only.

It has been renamed to `@multiformats/multiaddr` so please update your dependencies and replace usage in your code.

The API otherwise is compatible.
