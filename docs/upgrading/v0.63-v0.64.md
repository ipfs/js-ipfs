## libp2p

The upgrade to `ipfs@0.64.x` incorporates an update to `libp2p@0.38.x` but no API changes.

If your application uses only the default libp2p config there is nothing to do.

If you supply a custom `libp2p` instance to the `ipfs` factory function you should consult the [`libp2p@0.38.x` upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/migrations/v0.37-v0.38.md) for any changes you need to make.
