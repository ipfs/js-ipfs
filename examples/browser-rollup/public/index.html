    <h1>IPFS in the Browser</h1>
    <p>
      This page creates an IPFS node in your browser and drops it into the global
      Javascript namespace as
      <b><em style="background-color: #d7d6d6">node</em></b
      >. Open the console to play around with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that opening two tabs of this page in the same browser won't work well, because
      they will share node configuration. You'll end up trying to run two instances of the
      same node, with the same private key and identity, which is a Bad Idea.
    </p>

    <h3>IPFS</h3>
    <div id="status">Creating the IPFS node...</div>
