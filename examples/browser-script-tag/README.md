# Use IPFS in the browser with `<script>` tags

You can use IPFS in your in-browser JavaScript code with just a `<script>` tag.

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ipfs/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

This exposes a global `Ipfs`; you can get a node by making a `new Ipfs()`.

See `index.html` for a working example.
