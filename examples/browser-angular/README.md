## Getting Started

A minimal demonstration of how to use js-ipfs with Vue.

### Prerequisites

N/A

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oliveriosousa/js-ipfs-example-browser-angular.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

## Usage

### Development server

```sh
npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

```sh
npx ng generate component component-name
```

Generates a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

Execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

Execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
