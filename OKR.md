# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q4

# A viable alternative to Go IPFS

* P0 - @vasco-santos - DHT is enabled by default and interoperates with Go IPFS DHT
* P1 - @vasco-santos - IPNS is functional over pubsub and the DHT
* P0 - @alanshaw - Base32 CIDv1 migration is complete
* P0 - @alanshaw - A JS IPFS daemon is part of the IPFS gateways
* P2 - @hugomrdias - JS IPFS runs on the same ports as Go IPFS and uses the same binary name
* P2 - @hugomrdias - An IPFS version manager CLI tool exists to switch between go/js/whatever versions e.g. nvm/nave
* P0 - @achingbrain - npm-on-ipfs is the default registry that IPFS developers and CI use to install npm dependencies

# Measurably faster and smaller than ever before

* P0 - @hugomrdias - JS IPFS is capable of transferring a large dataset like ImageNet at least 75% as fast as Go IPFS
* P2 - @hugomrdias - The browser bundle of IPFS is not more than 1.5MB (gzipped) in size
* P3 - @hugomrdias - Browser bundle size is measured over time and developers alerted if it increases above 1.5MB
* P1 - @alanshaw - A website is published to visually track a set of basic performance profiles of JS IPFS releases over historical versions

# Stable and future proof

* P0 - @hugomrdias - Error codes are added to all errors that originate directly from JS IPFS
* P2 - @alanshaw - Test quality is improved, duplicates removed and coverage increased
* P0 - @achingbrain - js-ipfs-unixfs-engine is decomposed into smaller modules for better maintainability, testability and reliability. The refactored modules are part of a JS IPFS release
* P2 - @achingbrain - Candidate modules for extraction from JS IPFS (e.g. js-ipfs-mfs) are identified and agreed
* P1 - @achingbrain - Continuous deployment is an option for all Protocol Labs JS projects. 3 IPFS/IPLD/libp2p projects are setup to be continuously deployed
* P1 - @achingbrain - A draft spec for unixfs-v2 is written
