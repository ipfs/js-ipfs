# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q3

**The Connectivity Magic story is figured out and solved**

- A js-ipfs Daemon will always find other IPFS Daemons (js & go) in the LAN (MulticastDNS) - @diasdavid
- The DHT is enabled by default in js-ipfs - @diasdavid
- A js-ipfs node (Browser & Desktop) always finds files that are on the Gateways

**Daemon is as reliable as it can be**

- A Daemon runs for 10 days without a crash - @alanshaw
- One or more js-ipfs daemons are part of the Bootsrapper nodes 
- js-ipfs can handle 1TB of data, both Node.js and Browser - @hugomrdias
- npm on IPFS over js-ipfs is a sound way to install deps and gets used for CI - @achingbrain

**New user/contributor experience is extraordinary**

- js.ipfs.io is finished and published - @diasdavid
- Onboard 2 new full time contributors - @diasdavid
- Complete the Awesome Endeavour, Documentation
- Cut CI testing time in js-ipfs and js-ipfs-api by 50% (2x) - @alanshaw

Once these OKRs are finished, you will be able to find them on the [2018 Q3 IPFS OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vjigg4locq4fO6JXyobS2yTx-k-fSzlFM5ngZDPDbQ/edit#gid=274358435)
