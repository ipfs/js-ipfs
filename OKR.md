# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q3

**The Connectivity Magic story is figured out and solved**

- `P1` - @diasdavid -     A js-ipfs Daemon will always find other IPFS Daemons (js & go) in the LAN (MulticastDNS)
- `P0` - @diasdavid -     The DHT is enabled by default in js-ipfs
- `P0` - ???        -      A js-ipfs node (Browser & Desktop) always finds files that are on the Gateways

**Daemon is as reliable as it can be**

- `P0` - @alanshaw -      A Daemon runs for 10 days without a crash 
- `P2` - ??? -            One or more js-ipfs daemons are part of the Bootsrapper nodes 
- `P0` - @hugomrdias -    js-ipfs can handle 1TB of data, both Node.js and Browser
- `P1` - @achingbrain -   npm on IPFS over js-ipfs is a sound way to install deps and gets used for CI

**New user/contributor experience is extraordinary**

- `P0` - @diasdavid -     js.ipfs.io is finished and published 
- `P0` - @diasdavid -     Onboard 2 new full time contributors 
- `P2` - ???        -     Complete the Awesome Endeavour, Documentation
- `P2` - @alanshaw  -     Cut CI testing time in js-ipfs and js-ipfs-api by 50% (2x) 

Once these OKRs are finished, you will be able to find them on the [2018 Q3 IPFS OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vjigg4locq4fO6JXyobS2yTx-k-fSzlFM5ngZDPDbQ/edit#gid=274358435)
